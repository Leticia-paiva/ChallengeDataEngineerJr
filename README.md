# Challenge Data Engineer Jr 

This repository contains the code for a data engineer challenge.

## Challenge 1
The first challenge has a MER diagram with my solution for the problem.

## Challenge 2
The second challenge has a python implementation for the problem.
I choose to use the pandas library to make easy to handle and analyse the json file data.

## Setup
1. Add the **data.json** file at the same folder of the python script.
2. Make sure the pandas library is installed:
```shell 
pip install pandas
```

## Running the script:
```shell 
python Challenge2.py
```

## Results
The results data from the queries are stored in csv files generated by the python script, **expect for the pageViews that is printed directly in the screen**.
These are generated csv files:
1. NumberOfSessionsByUser.csv
2. NumberOfSessionsByDate.csv
3. AverageSessionDurationByDate.csv
4. DailySessionByBrowsers.csv
